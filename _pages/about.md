I am a third year PhD student in the Economics Department at Harvard University. My fields of interests comprise Econometric Theory and Development. I am broadly interested in developing the tools and understanding necessary to develop and apply methods in the machine learning literature to economic problems, particularly in the estimation of treatment effects.

I hold a MSc in Industrial Engineering and Operations Research from UC Berkeley (2021), a B.S. in Economics (2019) &  a B.S. in Applied Mathematics (2018) from ITAM. Previously I worked as a Research Assistant at the Center of Economic Research (CIE) at ITAM.
